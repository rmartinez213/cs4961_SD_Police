The scale control places a scale in the corner of the map in either imperial or
metric units, or both.

### Usage

    <px-map>
      <px-map-tile-layer url='https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'></px-map-tile-layer>
      <px-map-control-scale imperial-units position="bottomright"></px-map-control-scale>
    </px-map>

You must specify at least one unit type for the scale or it will not be drawn.
Set one or both of the `imperialUnits` or `metricUnits` attributes. Using
both scales at the same time is supported.

### Ordering/stacking controls

Multiple controls can be placed in the same position e.g. ('bottomright' for the
bottom right-hand corner of the map). Controls will stack automatically in the
reverse order they were placed in the DOM. This means that controls that appear
later in the DOM will be placed above those that appear earlier.

For example, this map has two controls in the same bottom right position, a zoom
control and a scale control:

    <px-map>
      <px-map-control-zoom position="bottomright"></px-map-control-zoom>
      <px-map-control-scale position="bottomright" imperial-units></px-map-control-zoom>
    </px-map>

When the map draws, the zoom control will be on top of the scale control in the
bottom right corner of the map.
