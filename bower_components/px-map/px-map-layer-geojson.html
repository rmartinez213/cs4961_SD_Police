    Relative paths assume component is being run from inside an app or another component, where dependencies are flat

    'gulp serve' (or similar server setup) to enable correct finding of bower dependencies for local runs.

This subcomponent draws GeoJSON features as vectors on the map. Use it to draw
common shapes like points, lines, polygons, circles, and rectangles (see the
`data` attribute documentation for more info on what can be drawn).
The layer only accepts valid GeoJSON formatted data — sending in invalid data
that does not conform to the [GeoJSON spec](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html)
will cause the layer to fail and not draw.

### Usage

    <px-map>
      <px-map-layer-geojson data='{"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"type": "Feature","properties": {},"geometry": {"type": "Point","coordinates": [0.11278152465820314,52.23526420307733]}}]}'>
    </px-map-layer-geojson>
    </px-map>

#### Styling features

There are two ways to style the features that the layer draws. To style all the
features for the entire layer, use the `featureStyle` attribute. To style each
feature individually, add a `style` object to the feature's `properties`.
See the API documentation below for instructions on what style options are
available.

#### Displaying feature properties

Enable the `showFeatureProperties` attribute to show a popup with feature properties
when the user taps on a feature. This is a useful way to show relevant information
about each feature.
